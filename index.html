            </h1>
            <p class="lead text-black mb-4"><i>Quantum Machine Learning (QML)</i> is a research stream started in 2022 as a part of 
                the <a href="https://www.fire.umd.edu/">FIRE</a> program at the University of Maryland, College Park under the Technology & Applied Science cluster. 
                Since 2023 we are in collaboration with the <a href="https://hpcc.umd.edu/hpcc/qlab/"> National Quantum Laboratory at Maryland (QLab) </a> and one of the world's leading quantum computing hardware and software company <a href="https://ionq.com">IonQ</a>. </p>
                
                <p class="lead text-black mb-4"><i>Several existing courses at UMD cover the distinct fields of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning">machine learning
                (ML)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing (QC)</a> independently, but the QML research
                stream is the first one at the university to introduce first year students to a burgeoning new space that is currently 
                developing at the intersection of these fields: quantum machine learning.</p>
                
                <p class="lead text-black mb-4">
                    <!--The concept of performing ML on quantum computers
                has long been a goal of computer scientists from both specialties, and bleeding-edge new cloud quantum computing technology like the IBM <i>Qiskit</i><sup>TM</sup></sup> which we use in this course has finally provided the bridge between that dream and reality. -->
                The QML stream offers students a unique opportunity to gain early access and in-depth insights into this captivating new technology. 
                It provides a hands-on exploration, both at the software and hardware levels, of one of today's most intriguing and rapidly evolving fields of science.
                 This experience places you ahead of the curve and allows you to engage directly with the forefront of innovation.

            <p class="lead text-black mb-4">QML is a year-long, comprehensive, research experience intended for first-year students.
                
            <p class="lead text-black mb-4">Spring Semester: This is the first semester in the sequence. Students will spend their 
                initial weeks creating strong foundational understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing and machine learning, 
                 including Superposition, Entanglement, Quantum Gates, Quantum Algorithms, Quantum Parallelism,
                 Quantum Decoherence, Quantum Supremacy, and principles of artificial intelligence, deep learning, classification/regression problems. 
                Regarding quantum hardware, our primary focus centers on Trapped Ions and Superconducting Qubits, 
                as well as the critical domain of Quantum Error Correction.

                Rest of the semester we will work on google Colab notebooks and study speculated impacts of QC over classical computers in fields such as 
                cryptography, optimization, and machine learning data analysis in general.
                
                
               <p class="lead text-black mb-4"> Fall Semester: This is the second semester in the sequence. 
                Now our emphasis shifts towards conceiving and executing independent projects. 
                These projects can be software or data analysis-centric, or they can revolve around quantum hardware.
                 You have the option to work individually or collaborate with a small group of fellow students. 
                
                We use the concepts and the state-of-the-art tools and techniques in quantum computing and machine learning to analyze Big Data  
                sourced directly either from  detectors recording high-energy proton-proton collisions at the 
                Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva  or particle data collected by underground experiments, originating 
                from astrophysical sources such as supernovas, gamma ray bursts, and black holes. During this semester you will also get access to one 
                of  the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, <a href="https://home.web.cern.ch/science/computing/grid">WLCG</a>  
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/umdt3public">Tier 3</a> centers owned by the HEP group in the UMD Physics Department.

            </h1>
            <p class="lead text-black mb-4">If you're a student interested in exploring quantum machine learning further, we would be happy to have you join the program!
                If you're an incoming freshman at the university, you may apply to be admitted to the First-year Innovation & Research Experience (FIRE) program <a href="https://www.fire.umd.edu/join">here</a>.
                Once admitted, you will enroll in the general-purpose first semester course <i>FIRE120</i>, and afterwards will have the opportunity to enroll in our <i>FIRE198</i> & <i>FIRE298</i> course sequence during
                the subsequent Spring and Fall.</p>
            <p class="lead text-black mb-4">QML only requires 1 hour of class time per week, but research students are expected to spend additional time for discussions, project work, and collaborative activities during the week as well.
                <!-- For the introductory portion of the course, students will complete a series of brief activities intended to familiarize them with fundamentals of data analysis, 
                and staple machine learning tasks such as clustering and regression. Later we work on similar activities but with IBM <i>Qiskit</i><sup>TM</sup></sup> and the with quantum circuits rather than conventional neural networks.--> 
            </p>

                <p class="lead text-black mb-4">During the latter part of the course,
                students will work with <a href="https://www.fire.umd.edu/leadership">peer research mentors</a> and their classmates in small groups to propose a plan for designing and implementing an independent
                Quantum Machine Learning project using the skills they have learned in the previous weeks. This proposal will undergo revision and approval by the professor, and students will then be given
                guided research time to collaborate, discuss, plan, and ultimately realize their proposals. Students will ultimately have an opportunity to present their completed
                projects at the <a href="https://www.fire.umd.edu/summit">FIRE Summit</a> in November as well as other events showcasing undergrad research at UMD.</p>
